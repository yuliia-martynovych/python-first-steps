# Python Basics Exercises

This repository contains my first steps in learning Python.  
It includes basic exercises and small scripts that help me understand fundamental programming concepts such as:

-   Variables and data types
-   Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
-   Loops (`for`, `while`)
-   Functions
-   Lists and dictionaries
-   Input and output
-   Simple error handling

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is **to practice and become confident with core Python syntax and logic**.  
All exercises are written with clarity and simplicity in mind, as a personal learning journey.
